# 2019

## 7

#### 8 . Start TIL

- Set *github repo* for TIL
- Create an *Alias* for typora in `.bash_profile`
- How to use `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc`
- Commit this sentences
- How to make a strategy in N-Queens

I think that to use typora helps for my software and english skill.

#### 9 . Make a solution in N-Rooks

- [indexOf vs for-loop](https://medium.com/@mrashes2/indexof-vs-for-loop-6a9f7bd5c646)
- How about complexity in **2 indexOf function**? <!--It is not high, discuss on 7.13-->
- Find a single N-Rooks solution <!--It looks like wrong solution, discuss on 7.13-->
- Understand permutation matrix and create this in javascript

Understanding permutation algorithm is very hard to me,  but I don't give up.

#### 10 . Very hard to solve N-Queens algorithm

- To solve N-Queens, we must understands N-Rooks algorithm
- N-Rooks looks like *permutation matrix*, but I want to solve to other ways <!--It looks like wrong solution, discuss on 7.13-->
- First of all, the solution of N-Queens is connected N-Rooks algorithm <!--It looks like wrong solution, discuss on 7.13-->
- Therefore, the time complexity of N-Queens is expected to be very high (However, I did not measure it)
- `Array.from({length: 4})` => `[undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined] ` 

I have a weakness for these algorithms. It was very hard work and new challenge for my code level.

And Tomorrow, I will learn another things for React.js.

#### 11 . Prepare about this, Prototype for Interview

- `this` does not refer to itself (function)
- `this` does not refer to *functional lexical scope*
- `this` is binding at *runtime*, not at created time
- `this` is determined by the context at *the time of the function call*

`this` is not an easy topic in JavaScript. This time, I want to learn `this` perfectly. Everything is up to me.

#### 12 . Prepare Job Profile

Today, I prepared my job profile and so I did almost nothing.

#### 13 . N-Queens Day

- To solve N-Queens algorithm, I realized that we must not use permutation matrix
- **Backtracking** is one of best solution in N-Queens problem (Algorithms - Sprint Review)
- Learn *how to module* a function (Algorithms - Sprint Review)
- I used **2 indexOf function** in rowConflict, today I realized it was nice code

The strategy that we make is not a solution, but a wrong answer. He said, It looks like `makeNRooksSolution() ` instead of `findNRooksSolution()`. I think that to solve this algorithm, we did not know what the meaning of the solution really was.

#### 14 . Online interview

- Why eslint recommend `i += 1` better than `i++`
- **Babel** is a JavaScript compiler
  - It is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 
    2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current 
    and older browsers or environments.
  - We maybe add polyfills for what babel missed
- What is [CSS3 Animation(key frame)](https://webclub.tistory.com/482)
- I forgot the keyword *payload*, it is used for HTTP requests

The online interview with *gomi corporation* was very good experience for me. It was not hard, but soft. The day after tomorrow, I will finally meet directors of *gomi corp* and I am expecting for this meeting.

#### 15 . Web Architecture

- How to operate **HTTP request** (GET, POST)
- How to read API docs
- I am used to`document.createElement('div');`
- `<input>` & `<textarea>` does not work with innerHTML method, but value.

Today I learned how to operate Client & Server. I must know how to read API docs and what gives from API. And then I will request resources from server API and use them. Maybe It's not easy. 

#### 16 . Technical Interview

- How to proceed technical interview : coding test + role playing
- **Type check problem** (in *Run.js*)

Today I took technical interview with *gomi corp*. I think it was very good experience, because it was my first technical interview. So, I did nothing today. zzz...

#### 17 . HTML, CSS, JS

- [`input type="submit"` vs `button`](https://webdir.tistory.com/421)
- To make a chat room with scroll, I used *overflow* and *height* properties in CSS and typed simple JS codes that *scrolltop* is same with *scrollheight* : `chat.scrollTop = chat.scrollHeight;`

To proceed a chatterbox splint is not difficult and funny. My team made a plan that makes the chatterbox with many functions. So, I'm afraid but curious about the chatterbox's quality.

#### 18 . Last Interview

Today I negotiated working conditions with *gomi corp*. They offered me nice conditions but told me to work from next week. It is too early to prepare. But they looks like good team and I want to work very soon. So I accepted this suggestion, this weekend I will study *React.js* for work.

#### 19 . Pair for work

**Grid Layout** is powerful tool to divide a page. It is fast to learn and easy to use. But it is possible to occur Cross Browsing problems.

#### 21 . Browser Security & React Component

- CORS : Cross-Origin Resourse Sharing
  - Simple requests
  - Preflighted requests
  - Requests with credentials
- ~~CSS~~ XSS : Cross-Site Script
  - Attacker sends XSS payload
  - Victim views XSS payload (Victim is a user)
- CSRF or XSRF : Cross-Site Request Forgery
- *React* makes *tags*, It is called *React Component* (like module)
- To use React, we must knows these ES6 features
  - *destructuring*
  - *spread operator*
  - *rest parameters*
  - *default parameters*
  - *template literals*
  - *arrow function*
  - *for-of loop*

To commit every night is hard to me. I must commit tonight !!!

#### 22 . Main Concepts about React

- `setState()`

#### 23 . Set-up gomicorp

- Install *Node*.js & *Rails*
- Make a React App with CSS Grid Layout

- `minmax()`
- *auto-fit* vs *auto-fill*

#### 26 . Shoot Schedule

I don't know how to bind *this* in React.

#### 27 . How to Use Youtube API in React

- How to get Youtube API using XHR
- `JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)`
- Deliver *props* and *state* to *components*

We used Youtube API to search videos in youtube. It was hard to do, because there is an error with many requests. But tomorrow I will solve this problem.

#### 28 . React Router

- What is SPA?
- How to use *react-router-dom*
- *pages* and *components*

Today I learned How to divided to pages to use a library called *react-router-dom*.

#### 29 . Complete Recast.ly

- After invoking `onChange()` *function*, `setState()` *function* is called
- Target value is changed in `<input>`, and you click a *submit button* when you are done
- `onChange={props.change}`

#### 30 . Reusable

- Deliver a *location.path* to *child components*
- Create a ***List component*** and Reuse it
- Foldering *component* files

- Understand when use a *class keyword* and *arrow function* in React
- How much divide to *components*?

I Was Born to Do React. (*Like "I Was Born to Love You"*)

## 8

#### 1 . Can I Use CSS Grid Layout

- Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system
- It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows
- Flexbox is a 1-dimensional system.
- Grid Layout polyfill does not exist, but what is this?

#### 2 . Solve Grid Layout

- *Redux* vs *Hooks*
- Bingo problem (from Bj)

#### 3 . Ready to Make To-Do List by React

- **styled-components** : `yarn add styled-components`

#### 4 . Happppy Birthday

Yesterday is my mother-in-law's birthday. So we had a party today, and I didn't do anything.

#### 5 . React Hooks

- The motivation of *React Hooks* is to reuse stateful logic between components
- [When to use *useState* or *useReducer*?](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-usereducer-vs-usestate/#usestate-vs-usereducer)
- *Hooks* are available in *React* 16.8 (ver)
- *Hooks* is used with *props*: It is possible!!

#### 6 . Refactoring to use Hooks

- Remove *class* keywords : *class* & *extends* is not needed
- Only Use Hooks in *components* that consist of a *const* keyword
- Do not use `setState()`, but use `useState()`

Using *React Hooks* is better than using pure React. I'm satisfied *Hooks*. And maybe It is better than *Redux*.

#### 7 . Miss TIL

This day was too busy because of works. I don't remember anything.

#### 8 . useState & useEffect

- How to use `useState()` and `useEffect()`
  - These are basics of *React Hooks*

- Concat new object to data list in React

#### 10 . useState & useEffect ???

- [Is useState() asynchronous?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54119678/is-usestate-synchronous)
- What is `useEffect()`? I don't understand when it is needed.

#### 11 . Props and State

- **props** are variables passed to it by its parent component
- **State** on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component
- The state can be initialized by props

#### 12 . Test

Pure *React*(like setState) has many many this.state blah blah. *React Hooks* is simple than pure *React*. *Recursion* is still hard to me....
