### 8 : Start TIL

- Set *github repo* for TIL
- Create an *Alias* for typora in `.bash_profile`
- How to use `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc`
- Commit this sentences

I think that to use typora helps for my software and english skill.

### 9 : make a solution in N-Rooks

- [indexOf vs for-loop](https://medium.com/@mrashes2/indexof-vs-for-loop-6a9f7bd5c646)
- How about complexity in **2 indexOf**?
- Find a single N-Rooks solution

Understanding permutation algorithm is very hard to me,  but I don't give up.
