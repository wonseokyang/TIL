### 8 : Start TIL

- Set *github repo* for TIL
- Create an *Alias* for typora in `.bash_profile`
- How to use `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc`
- Commit this sentences
- How to make a strategy in N-Queens

I think that to use typora helps for my software and english skill.

### 9 : make a solution in N-Rooks

- [indexOf vs for-loop](https://medium.com/@mrashes2/indexof-vs-for-loop-6a9f7bd5c646)
- How about complexity in **2 indexOf**?
- Find a single N-Rooks solution
- Understand permutation matrix and create this in javascript

Understanding permutation algorithm is very hard to me,  but I don't give up.

### 10 : Very hard to solve N-Queens algorithm

- To solve N-Queens, we must understands N-Rooks algorithm
- N-Rooks looks like *permutation matrix*, but I want to solve to other ways
- First of all, the solution of N-Queens is connected N-Rooks algorithm
- Therefore, the time complexity of N-Queens is expected to be very high (However, I did not measure it)
- `Array.from({length: 4}) === [undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined] ` is *true*

I have a weakness for these algorithms. It was very hard work and new challenge for my code level.

And Tomorrow, I will learn another things for React.js.
